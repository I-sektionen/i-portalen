This folder is used by Openshift. To serve static contents. Content not belonging
to any special app can be put here, otherwise place the static content next to each app.


Old Readme:

Public, static content goes here.  Users can create rewrite rules to link to
content in the static dir.  For example, django commonly uses /media/
directories for static content.  For example in a .htaccess file in a
wsgi/.htaccess location, developers could put:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^application/media/(.+)$ /static/media/$1 [L]

Then copy the media/* content to yourapp/wsgi/static/media/ and it should
just work.

Note: The ^application/ part of the URI match is required.
